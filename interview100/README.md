# some interview problems 

give the solutions for the problems from [http://zhedahht.blog.163.com/](http://zhedahht.blog.163.com/)

## import problems

14. solve josephus problmes with math formular.(14th problem in above web site)
    f(n, m) = [f(n-1, m) + m] % n

21. solve 21th problme, using "reverse"  (X^T Y^T)^T = YX

23. a classic problmes, a series of fibonacci ! (23th problem)

25. 25th problem, encounter many times..
    compute the total number of '1' from 1..n

26. 34th problem. 'xor' is a good way!! 


## ignored problems

1. 8th problem -- calc the sum of 1..n without loop, condition statement and recursion.
   it can be solved by template and construct function.

2. 12th problem -- iterator a binary tree with layer-order.
   this sub-problem is solved by other tree problem. ex, in 11th problem.

3. 16th problem -- write an copy construct to implement deep copy. 

4. 17th problem -- convert an string to interger. 
   this problem should be considered more carefully, handling many exceptions.

5. 23th problem -- a series of fibonacci problem. it is also in import problems list.

6. 28th problem -- full permutation.

7. 30th problem -- overload "=" operator, please NOTICE that using temp object can implement rleaseing memory automatically.

8. 31th problem -- use recursion to implement it. it is elegant.

9. 38th problem -- all permutation, or use high-precision to solve it.

10. 40th problem -- handle '0' situation.

11. 41th problem -- an odd sort - -!.
